# Tra quanto passa (l'autobus)

*Tra quanto passa* is a simple web application that shows the arrival times of buses in the city of Trento.

It also takes into consideration delays based on real-time data.

It's currently hosted on `traquantopassa.in`, e.g. https://traquantopassa.in/mesiano.

The application was built with the Nuxt 3 framework, which I don't really know how to use so it's likely a mess. 

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```
